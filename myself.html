<!--Youâ€™ll very often see divs used to group related paragraphs,
     images, headings, and links. For example, a three-paragraph article may be enclosed in a div, and a navigation menu containing links might be enclosed in another div. Using divs this way makes it easier to identify
     different sections of a page and apply styling to them with CSSThe div (division) element is a generic block-level element, most often used to divide page content into blocks. A block element is a page element that
     starts a new line and has a width equal to the entire page or the parent container. -->

    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>

    and height was assigned here so its only taking up the space allocated
